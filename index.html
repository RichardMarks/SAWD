        <h2>SAWD</h2>

<h1>ASCII Mini-RPG for the 2008 contest being held at <a href="http://www.rpgdx.net">http://www.rpgdx.net</a>
</h1>

<p>SAWD stands for Simple ASCII Walk-around Demo, and is a short RPG developed in C with very little C++ in as little time as possible by Richard Marks. Tools used were Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008, Notepad, and Microsoft Paint.</p>

<p>The story is pretty much non existent, with only a few short dialogs that happen at certain places in the game. The game focuses on battling to prepare yourself for the stronger enemies that you will face at the end of the demo. A very simple item and magic system has been employed, and the battles are designed to be very easy to play. Your character can be any one of four classes, Warrior, Dwarf, Thief, Mage. Each character class can use its own weapon. Warriors use Swords. Dwarves use Axes, Thieves use Bows, Mages use Staves. You can equip your character with 3 types of armor. Vest, Boots, and Gauntlets.  Giving Upper, Lower, and Middle armor attributes. For magic, only a Mage can learn magic spells. Other classes need to purchase Magic Scroll items to cast spells. If you are a Mage, you can learn magic spells in the Magic Shops. Once you learn a skill you can use it for the rest of the game. You will use MP each time you cast a spell. Magic Scrolls can only be used once each. SAWD features a one-on-one turn-based battle system featuring menus that you control using the keyboard to select action to take on your turn.</p>
