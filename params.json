{"name":"Sawd","tagline":"Win32 Console ASCII Traditional RPG","body":"## SAWD\r\nASCII Mini-RPG for the 2008 contest being held at http://www.rpgdx.net\r\n====\r\nSAWD stands for Simple ASCII Walk-around Demo, and is a short RPG developed in C with very little C++ in as little time as possible by Richard Marks. Tools used were Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008, Notepad, and Microsoft Paint.\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty much non existent, with only a few short dialogs that happen at certain places in the game. The game focuses on battling to prepare yourself for the stronger enemies that you will face at the end of the demo. A very simple item and magic system has been employed, and the battles are designed to be very easy to play. Your character can be any one of four classes, Warrior, Dwarf, Thief, Mage. Each character class can use its own weapon. Warriors use Swords. Dwarves use Axes, Thieves use Bows, Mages use Staves. You can equip your character with 3 types of armor. Vest, Boots, and Gauntlets.  Giving Upper, Lower, and Middle armor attributes. For magic, only a Mage can learn magic spells. Other classes need to purchase Magic Scroll items to cast spells. If you are a Mage, you can learn magic spells in the Magic Shops. Once you learn a skill you can use it for the rest of the game. You will use MP each time you cast a spell. Magic Scrolls can only be used once each. SAWD features a one-on-one turn-based battle system featuring menus that you control using the keyboard to select action to take on your turn.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n+ Manual Name Entry Screen\r\n+ Multiple Character Classes\r\n+ Random Character Generation System\r\n+ ASCII Sprites\r\n+ One-on-One Encounter Engine With Items, Skills, and Probabilistic\r\n+ Chance of Escape and Reward\r\n+ Random and Scripted Battles\r\n+ Items, Equipment, Magic\r\n+ Inns, Shops, Scripted Story Events\r\n+ Realtime Keyboard Navigation Controls\r\n+ Custom Multi-State In-Game Menus\r\n+ Custom Dialog Box System\r\n+ Savegame Support for up to 3 Simultaneous Games\r\n\r\n## Field Controls\r\nW, A, S, D keys to move the player's avatar\r\nESC to open the menu\r\nSpace to advance dialogue boxes\r\nSpace to confirm an action\r\nBackspace to cancel an action\r\n\r\n## Battle Controls\r\nW, A, S, D keys to move selection cursor\r\nSpace to confirm an action\r\nBackspace to cancel an action\r\n\r\n## Shop Controls\r\nW, S to move the cursor\r\nA, D to increase or decrease quantity when cursor is on an item\r\nSpace to confirm action","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
